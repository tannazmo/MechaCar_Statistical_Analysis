## Deliverable 1 : Linear Regression to Predict MPG
write a short summary using a screenshot of the output from the linear regression, and address the following questions:
In this deliverable, I created the Multiple Linear Regression that predicts the mpg of MechaCar prototypes using several variables.
and the result is showing in th console as below:

![console](deliverable_one.png "multiple linear regression model")

#### Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

According to our results, vehicle_length and ground_clearance provided non-random amounts of variance to the linear model. 
In other words the vehicle_length and ground_clearance have a significant impact on mpg. 

#### Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

#### Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
the R-squared value is 0.7149
